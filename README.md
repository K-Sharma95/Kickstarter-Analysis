# An Analysis of Campaigns funded through Kickstarter
This respoitory includes multiple components of an analysis of Kickstarter campaigns from 2009-2017 using descriptive analysis techniques and various visualizations.

## OVERVIEW: 
The purpose of this analysis is to accurately analyse the data, and communicate substantial findings and tendencies in order to improve decision making, and resultingly campaign success. The analysis has been focused on best informing the decisions of the client Louis, who is launching a campaign in order to funda play in the U.S. 

## ANALYSIS AND CHALLENGES: 
The analysis began by first filtering, sorting and re-formatting the data. Our client has a particular interest in certain categories of our data, including but notlimited to the theatre ceategories and countries such as the United States of America and Great Britian. I began by creating columns of data for the purposes of sorting by category and subcategory. It was also beneficial to sort the data into four outcome categories; successful, failed, live and canceled. By drawing comparisons with these four categories we are 
able to distincly determine the properties of succesful campaigns, and unsuccessful ones. After this was concluded, the data was organizaed and visualized using Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts. Once the visualizations had been completed the analysis shifted to successful and failed campaigns in the U.S., as this was the primary country of interest for the client Louis. Descriptive statictis were calculated and central tendencies were discovered. Finally a box and whisker plot was created analyzing the data for musicals in Great Britian, another area of interest. The difficulties faced during this analysis were mainly experienced withinconsistent use of excel. I struggled with creating some forumula and effectively populating tables, however multiple attempts and deliberation solved these issues. 

## RESULTS:
After analyzing the data several conclusions can be made. Firtly it can be concluded that campaings sorted into the "theater" category are most successful when launched in May and June. This can be seen in the Theater Outcomes based on Launch Date figure ![image_name](path/to/image_name.png).   The number of successful campaings can be seen dramatically rising during these months.This suggests Louis will be most likely to succeed if she launches her campaign at this
time. A second conclusing that can be made by observing the Theater Outcomes based on Launch Date is that failed campaings are much more even, without major spikes or booms in numbers based on launch date. This suggests other factors are more relevant to capmaigns failing, there isnt enough consistency to determine how launch date affects project failure. 

A conclusion that can be made about the Outcomes based on Goals visulaization, ![image_name](path/to/image_name.png), is as follows; the highest percentage of campaigns (in this case plays) are most successful when the 
fundraising goal is below $15,000.00, or between $40,000 and $45,000

This data set has a few limitations however that affect this project. A large limitation of this data is the lack on information on the funding received. The data does not contain any information on the individual
contributors that make up the pledges. This information would be beneficial to understand how exactly funding goals are met. A second limitation of this data is that it does not account for campaign activities after they are
successful and funding goals are met. The actual project that each kickstart campaign is associated with is not listed in the data, it would be beneficial to see how these projects fare once fully realised.
